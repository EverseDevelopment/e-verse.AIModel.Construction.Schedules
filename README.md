This repo are a couple of machine learning models trained with the data of more than 70 buildings. We took the data from this [repo](https://github.com/EverseDevelopment/Buildings.Historical.Data) </h3>
<br/>
 
## Getting Started

The function of each model is the following:

1. Category predictor: This model was used to group task of schedules into categories with the same name.

2. Task Delay Classifier: If a model will have a delay or not.

3. Task Delay Regressor: How much delay will be for each task.
